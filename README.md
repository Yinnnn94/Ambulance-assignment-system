# Selenium-ambulace-attendance
1. I used Selenium to grab down the Taiwan Douliu ambulance attenendance, happening loaction, distribution department, types...\
2. I transform the loaction to latitude and longitude.
3. I drew the loaction to the map by folium module.
## Found out there is something interesting!
- Some nearer department they didn't dispatch
- Some spent too much time!
### Here I want to improve
- Using dijkstra algorithm 
- Consider the patient type to the responsed time
### Download them first for preparing Selenium module
